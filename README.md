# Bonfire-Night-Bookwyrm-Theme
The lightweight 'Bonfire Night' theme for Bookwyrm that includes CSS-based twinkling stars and glowing embers animations. The theme is light, clutter-free, cosy, and easy on the eyes. It also uses a new default font called Lora, designed in 2019 by Olga Karpushina. All animations are done using CSS pseudo-elements and the original `$body-background` is set to `transparent`

This repository includes the variable TTFs for Google Font Lora, as well as the `.scss` file for the theme.

[Bookwyrm](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social) is an ActivityPub based social reading web application.
